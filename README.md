Sonify
========

Sonify is a simple text-to-speech engine built using Python. It uses the NLTK, NumPy and PyAudio libraries.

To get it running on a Linux machine, first do the following:
- sudo apt-get install python-pip

If you're on a Mac, do this instead:
- brew install python-pip

Once that's done, use the following commands to install the required Python libraries
- sudo pip install nltk
- sudo pip install numpy
- sudo pip install pyaudio

To run the program, type "python phonemer.py [words_to_say]".

**Note that this program isn't yet complete, and is in a highly-prototype state.**
